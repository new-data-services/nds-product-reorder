# Shopware Product Reorder Plugin

With this plugin you can simply reorder already ordered products of your previous purchases from your customer shop account.

The plugin extends the order view in your customer account with an additional button for reordering individual products. 
This gives you the option of placing individual products from your order or from different orders directly in the shopping basket and ordering them again. 

If a product is no longer available, the reorder button is automatically hidden. 
If a product is marked for "clearance sale" and the stock level drops to zero, the reorder button is deactivated.

## Requirement

- Shopware 6.6

``composer require nds/product-reorder``
